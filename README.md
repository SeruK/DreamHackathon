DreamHackathon
==============

This repository will be filled with a VR project which we will make during DreamHackathon: VR! The project will be totally open to the public (for now at least).

Initial setup done beforehand:

1. Created a private GitHub repo
  * Figured out the folder structure I (SeruK) want to use (this changed)
  *	Added a bunch of ignores to said GitHub repo
  
2. Downloaded Unity and got my pro license

3. Setup iOS stuff (this is a fucking nightmare)
  * Renewed my iOS Development Program
  * Added my iPhone 5 as a device to devcenter
  * Renewed my iOS Development Dev Cert (used same keysignreq)
  * Created DreamHackathon dev cert
  * Realized I didnâ€™t have the effing private key right and started over

4.	Setup Unity project
  * Force Text Serialization
  * Setup iOS Project settings (mainly bundle identifier, orientation)
	* Tested building an iOS project; remembered how much crap the Xcode project generates; decided to ignore it all together

5.	Downloaded Dive
  * Glad I did because of bs like needing to download Blender
  * Added to test project and did a test build to the phone - totally works!

6.  Get the rest of the team up and running with Unity and GitHub
